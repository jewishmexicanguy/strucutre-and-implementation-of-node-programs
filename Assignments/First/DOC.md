# How to run javascript as a script

normally when starting a node application you are used to running an npm command like

```bash
npm run start
```
However for the time being you will run javascript files as scripts and not as a module tp pick up some javascript basics

Assuming your terminal is in the desired directory, you will use the following pattern

```bash
node <name-of-file.js>
```

So *cd* into Assignemnts/First and run

```bash
node runMe.js
```
