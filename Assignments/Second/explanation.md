<!-- (4) - Research the difference between what an synchronous and asynchrnous process is in Node and write your explanation in a file called explanation.md -->

Sync = Synchronous = Blocking I/O model
synchronous code is executed in sequence – each statement waits for the previous statement to finish before executing.

Async = Asynchronous = Non-blocking I/O model
Asynchronous code doesn't have to wait – your program can continue to run. You do this to keep your site or app responsive, reducing waiting time for the user.
