# strucutre-and-implementation-of-node-programs
> SINP for short

This is going to be a series of small tutorials that will cummulativley build up on one another.

## Strucutre

Assignments will be located in the Assignment folder and have sub directories, with sequential names, like first, second, third ...
Each assignemnt folder will have a DOC.md that gives some information on a topic written in markdown for convencience of reading.
As well as a runMe.js file that wil hhave some javascript meant to be run by *you* to see an example of code being run.

There will also be an Assignment.md file which will have a challenge meant for *you* to solve and write a solution for.

I would suggest you write your solution on the same folder for ease of navigation and keep track of your work.
